\subsection{Part I}

Since the arrival rate and the number of stations is fixed, and the probability
of error varies, in order to select a scheme among the three queueing systems,
it is reasonable to consider the metric of end-to-end delay as the decisive
factor. The system that exhibits the least average delay is the one we shall
choose as the most preferable.

Figure \ref{fig:06_delay_1} shows the relation between the end-to-end delay
and the probability of error $p_{e,i}$, $i = \{1,2, \dots r+1\}$ for the three
different queueing networks considered.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering

  \caption{The relation between end-to-end delay and the probability of error
    in a queueing network with AF relaying with end-to-end AQR (\texttt{blue}),
    DF relaying and end-to-end ARQ (\texttt{red}) and
    DF relaying and hop-by-hop ARQ (\texttt{orange}) for $r=4$.}
  \label{fig:06_delay_1}
\end{figure}

What is evident here is that as the probability of error increases, the average
delay in the AF relaying with hop-by-hop ARQ system increases in a less rapid
fashion compared to the other two queueing networks. This system can tolerate
larger probability errors, and hence be more robust, while at the same time
appear lower end-to-end delay times.

\subsection{Part II}

Since the arrival rate, the number of stations, and the probability of error is
fixed, in order to select a scheme among the three queueing systems,
it is reasonable to consider the metric of end-to-end delay as the decisive
factor. The system that exhibits the least average delay is the one we shall
choose as the most preferable.

Figure \ref{fig:06_delay_2} shows the relation between the end-to-end delay
and the value of $k \in [1,4]$ for the three different queueing networks
considered.

Consulting figure \ref{fig:06_delay_3}, which shows a magnified portion of this
relation, it is evident that for $k \in [1, 1.97]$, DF relaying with hop-by-hop
ARQ exhibits lower average delay times than the other two queueing systems,
while for $k \in [1.97, 4]$ the lowest average delay times are exhibited by
the AF relaying with end-to-end ARQ system.

    lowest average delay changes.}
