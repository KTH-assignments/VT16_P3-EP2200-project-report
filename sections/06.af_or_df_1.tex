Since the arrival rate and the number of stations is fixed, and the probability
of error varies, in order to select a scheme among the three queueing systems,
it is reasonable to consider the metric of end-to-end delay as the decisive
factor.

Figure \ref{fig:06_delay_1} shows the relation between the end-to-end delay
and the probability of error $p_{e,i}$, $i = \{1,2, \dots r+1\}$ for the three
different queueing networks considered.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering

  \caption{The relation between end-to-end delay and the probability of error
    in a queueing network with AF relaying with end-to-end AQR (\texttt{blue}),
    DF relaying and end-to-end ARQ (\texttt{red}) and
    DF relaying and hop-by-hop ARQ (\texttt{orange}) for $r=4$.}
  \label{fig:06_delay_1}
\end{figure}

What is evident here is that as the probability of error increases, the average
delay in the AF relaying with hop-by-hop ARQ system increases in a less rapid
fashion compared to the other two queueing networks. This system can tolerate
larger probability errors, and hence be more robust, while at the same time
appear lower end-to-end delay times.
